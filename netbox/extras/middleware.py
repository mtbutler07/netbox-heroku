    This middleware performs three functions in response to an object being created, updated, or deleted:

        1. Create an ObjectChange to reflect the modification to the object in the changelog.
        2. Enqueue any relevant webhooks.
        3. Increment metric counter for the event type

    The post_save and post_delete signals are employed to catch object modifications, however changes are recorded a bit
    differently for each. Objects being saved are cached into thread-local storage for action *after* the response has
    completed. This ensures that serialization of the object is performed only after any related objects (e.g. tags)
    have been created. Conversely, deletions are acted upon immediately, so that the serialized representation of the
    object is recorded before it (and any related objects) are actually deleted from the database.
